# BankLoanInsights
Bank Loan Insights Data Analysis Project
# 🏦 Bank Loan Report Analysis

## 📌 Project Description

This project involves a detailed analysis of bank loan data to evaluate loan issuance performance, repayment health, and monthly financial trends. It breaks down the loans into categories like Good and Bad loans and analyzes them by status such as Fully Paid, Charged Off, and Current.

## 📊 Objectives

- Track Total Funded and Received Amounts.
- Calculate and analyze:
- Average Interest Rate
- Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio
- Assess Good vs. Bad Loans based on applications and repayment.
- Monitor Monthly Performance:
- MoM (Month-over-Month) Growth
- MTD (Month-to-Date) Metrics
- Understand loan statuses and fund flows.

## 📈 Key Metrics

| Metric                        | Value     |
|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Total Funded Amount           | $435.8M   |
| Total Amount Received         | $473.1M   |
| Average Interest Rate         | 12.0%     |
| Average DTI                   | 13.3%     |
| Good Loan Applications        | 33.2K     |
| Bad Loan Applications         | 5.3K      |
| Good Loan Funded Amount       | $370.2M   |
| Bad Loan Funded Amount        | $65.5M    |
| MTD Funded Amount             | $54.0M    |
| MTD Received Amount           | $58.1M    |


## ✅ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel/CSV for raw data
- Power BI (optional for dashboards)

## 📢 Insights

- 86.2% of total loans are good loans, indicating strong credit filtering.
- Bad loans account for 13.8% of applications but have lower recovery ($37.3M out of $65.5M funded).
- Fully Paid loans show strong recovery performance.
- MTD and MoM metrics help assess loan trends and future risk.

## 📌 Future Scope

- Integrate a dashboard using Power BI/Tableau.
- Use ML models to predict future loan performance or bad loan probability.
- Track loan recovery time and borrower profile analysis.
